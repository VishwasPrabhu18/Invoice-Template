**This repository consists of HTML, CSS and images which are used to design an _INVOICE_ template using Vanilla JS**

# What is vanilla JavaScript?
VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery back in the days. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries." Or, in our case, without new, fancy frameworks.
